## üí° **HIGH PRIORITY - Implement These Next**

### **1. Smart Deadline Suggestions for Budget Items**
**Problem:** Couples forget payment deadlines, miss deposits, lose vendors
**Paige Solution:**

```
Insight: "5 budget items have no due dates"
Description: "Add smart payment deadlines based on industry standards and your wedding date."
Action: "Add Deadlines" ‚Üí Opens chat with suggestions

Chat: "I'll suggest realistic payment deadlines:
‚Ä¢ Venue Deposit - 30 days from now (book ASAP)
‚Ä¢ Photographer Deposit - 45 days from now
‚Ä¢ Wedding Dress Final Payment - 14 days before wedding
‚Ä¢ Catering Final Payment - 7 days before wedding"

[Add These Deadlines] button
```

**Implementation:**
- Read items without `dueDate`
- Calculate smart deadlines based on:
  - Item type (deposits vs final payments)
  - Days until wedding
  - Industry standards
  - Vendor booking windows
- Dispatch events to update due dates

---

### **2. Category Over-Allocation Warnings**
**Problem:** Couples allocate 50% to venue, have no budget left for other essentials
**Paige Solution:**

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Venue & Catering is 45% of budget
   Industry average: 35-40%. Consider rebalancing to leave room for other vendors.
   [View Allocation Breakdown]
```

**Industry Benchmarks:**

   ‚Ä¢ Sales tax (varies by state): ~$3,500
   ‚Ä¢ Overtime fees: $500-1,000
   ‚Ä¢ Alterations & tailoring: $300-500
   
   [Add Missing Categories]
```

‚Ä¢ Deposits (now): $8,500
‚Ä¢ Halfway payments (60 days out): $12,000

[Create Payment Schedule]
```

**Smart Features:**

### **5. Vendor Cost Comparison**
**Problem:** Couples don't know if quotes are reasonable
**Paige Solution:**

```
üí° Photographer quote seems high
   Your budget: $3,500
   Average in Philadelphia: $2,500-3,000
   This is in the top 20%. Consider shopping around or negotiating.
   
   [Find More Photographers]
```

**Data Sources:**
- User's budget allocation
- Wedding location
- Guest count
- Vendor category
- Industry averages (could use an API or static data)

---

### **6. Spending vs Booking Progress**
**Problem:** Couples spend money without securing vendors (or vice versa)
**Paige Solution:**

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Spending ahead of booking!
   You've spent $15,000 (30%) but only confirmed 2 of 8 vendors.
   Make sure deposits are securing services.
   
   [Review Vendor Status]
```

**Cross-Feature Intelligence:**
- Budget spent amount
- Vendors marked as "confirmed" (could track in vendors page)
- Todo completion for "Book [vendor]"
- Message confirmations

---

### **7. Category Consolidation Suggestions**
**Problem:** Too many tiny categories make tracking hard
**Paige Solution:**

```
üí° Simplify your budget tracking
   You have 3 small categories under $500 each.
   Consider merging into "Miscellaneous" for easier management.
   
   Categories to merge:
   ‚Ä¢ Wedding Rings ($400)
   ‚Ä¢ Marriage License ($100)
   ‚Ä¢ Guest Book ($80)
   
   [Merge Categories]
```

**Problem:** Couples forget which vendors are paid, risk double-paying or missing payments
**Paige Solution:**

```
‚è∞ 4 items marked as paid, 6 still unpaid
   Unpaid total: $28,500
   Next payment: Venue Final ($12,000) - due in 14 days
   
   [Review Unpaid Items]
```

---

### **9. Budget Buffer Recommendations**
**Problem:** Couples allocate 100%, have no buffer for changes/emergencies
**Paige Solution:**

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Zero budget buffer!
   You've allocated $56,000 of your $56,000 budget (100%).
   Industry best practice: Keep 10-15% unallocated for unexpected costs.
   
   Suggested buffer: $5,600-8,400
   
   [Adjust Allocations]
```

---

### **10. Seasonal Payment Timing**
**Problem:** Couples set random due dates, not aligned with actual payment schedules
**Paige Solution:**

```
üí° Optimize your payment timeline
   Typical schedule for your wedding (32 days out):
   ‚Ä¢ NOW: Final payments for venue, catering, photographer
   ‚Ä¢ 2 weeks out: Flowers, cake, transportation
   ‚Ä¢ 1 week out: Final details, gratuity prep
   
   [Update Payment Schedule]
```

---

### **11. Category Percentage Health Check**
**Problem:** Couples don't realize they're over-allocating until too late
**Paige Solution:**

```
Insight: "Budget allocation health check"
‚úÖ Venue: 45% (healthy, slightly high)
‚ö†Ô∏è Photography: 15% (high, avg is 10-12%)
‚úÖ Catering: In venue budget
‚ùå Flowers: 3% (low, avg is 8-10%)
‚ö†Ô∏è No allocation for: Gratuities, Alterations

[Rebalance Budget]
```

---

**Paige Solution:**

```
üí° Venue package often includes:
   Your venue budget: $25,200
   Typical inclusions: Tables, chairs, linens, coordinator
   
   Check if you're double-budgeting for:
   ‚Ä¢ Rentals (might be included)
   ‚Ä¢ Day-of coordinator (might be included)
   
   [Review Package Details]
```

---

### **13. Group Payment Suggestions**

```
