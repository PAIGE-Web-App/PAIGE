## 🔍 How It Works (Behind the Scenes)

### **Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **User visits vendor page**
   - Existing vendor data loads (no additional cost)
   
2. **Check for Instagram**
   - If Instagram exists: Display immediately ✅
   - If missing + has website: Trigger background scraping

3. **Background Scraping (Async)**
   - Scraper fetches vendor website (server-side)
   - Searches for Instagram links using pattern matching
   - Validates handle format
   - Takes 1-3 seconds

4. **Save to Cache**
   - Instagram saved to `communityVendors` collection
   - One Firestore write (~$0.001)
   - Benefits ALL users forever

5. **Display Result**
   - Instagram link appears on page
   - User can click to visit Instagram
   - Beautiful gradient styling

---

## 💰 Cost Breakdown

### **Per User (20 vendors, 15 with websites):**
- Scraping: **$0** (server-side, no API costs)
- Firestore writes: **~$0.015** (one-time, ~12 successful scrapes)
- Ongoing: **$0** (cached forever)

### **System-Wide (1000 users):**
- First-time scraping: **~$15** (one-time setup)
- Ongoing operations: **$0** (all data cached)
- **Total**: ~$15 one-time investment

After initial scraping, **every new user benefits at zero cost!**

---
