# 📊 Email Integration Field Verification

## ✅ Field Mapping: Settings Page → Welcome Email

This document verifies that the welcome email integration uses the **exact same fields** as saved in the Settings page.

---

## 🔍 Firestore Fields Used

### **From `/app/settings/hooks/useProfileForm.ts` (lines 150-162)**

When user clicks "Save" on the Wedding Details tab, these fields are saved to Firestore:

```typescript
const updateData: any = {
  weddingDate: weddingDate ? new Date(weddingDate) : deleteField(),
  weddingDateUndecided,                    // boolean
  weddingLocation,                         // string
  weddingLocationUndecided,                // boolean
  hasVenue,                                // boolean | null
  vibe,                                    // string[]
  vibeInputMethod,                         // string
  generatedVibes,                          // string[]
  maxBudget: maxBudget,                    // number
  guestCount,                              // number
  additionalContext,                       // string
};
```

## ✅ Welcome Email Integration

### **From `/lib/emailIntegrations.ts` (lines 89-98)**

The welcome email fetches these **exact same fields**:

```typescript
const emailUserData = {
  weddingDate: weddingDate,                // ✅ MATCH - Date object
  weddingDateUndecided: userData.weddingDateUndecided || false,  // ✅ MATCH
  weddingLocation: userData.weddingLocation || null,             // ✅ MATCH
  weddingLocationUndecided: userData.weddingLocationUndecided || false,  // ✅ MATCH
  hasVenue: userData.hasVenue || false,    // ✅ MATCH
  partnerName: userData.partnerName || null,  // ✅ MATCH (from Account tab)
  guestCount: userData.guestCount || null,    // ✅ MATCH
  maxBudget: userData.maxBudget || null,      // ✅ MATCH
};
```

---

## 🎯 Conditional Logic Verification

### **Email Template Conditional Checks** (`/lib/emailService.ts`)

#### **1. Wedding Date Check**
```typescript
// Line 298
const hasWeddingDate = userData?.weddingDate && !userData?.weddingDateUndecided;
```
✅ **Correct**: Uses both `weddingDate` AND checks `weddingDateUndecided` is `false`

**Settings Logic**:
- If checkbox "We haven't decided yet" is checked → `weddingDateUndecided = true`
- If checkbox is unchecked → `weddingDateUndecided = false`
- If date is set → `weddingDate = Date object`

---

#### **2. Wedding Location Check**
```typescript
// Line 299
const hasLocation = userData?.weddingLocation && !userData?.weddingLocationUndecided;
```
✅ **Correct**: Uses both `weddingLocation` AND checks `weddingLocationUndecided` is `false`

**Settings Logic**:
- If checkbox "We haven't decided yet" is checked → `weddingLocationUndecided = true`
- If checkbox is unchecked → `weddingLocationUndecided = false`
- If location is set → `weddingLocation = string`

---

#### **3. Venue Check**
```typescript
// Line 300
const hasVenue = userData?.hasVenue === true;
```
✅ **Correct**: Checks `hasVenue` is strictly `true`

**Settings Logic**:
- If "Yes, we have a venue" is selected → `hasVenue = true`
- If "Not yet" is selected → `hasVenue = false`
- Initially → `hasVenue = null`

---

## 📋 Email Content Logic

### **When User HAS Wedding Date:**
```
✓ Your wedding is on June 15, 2026 - 234 days away!
```
✅ Shows when: `weddingDate !== null && weddingDateUndecided === false`

### **When User DOESN'T HAVE Wedding Date:**
```
📅 Set your wedding date in Settings to get personalized planning timelines
```
✅ Shows when: `weddingDate === null || weddingDateUndecided === true`

---

### **When User HAS Location:**
```
✓ Planning in San Francisco, CA - great choice!
```
✅ Shows when: `weddingLocation !== null && weddingLocationUndecided === false`

### **When User DOESN'T HAVE Location:**
```
📍 Add your wedding location to get venue suggestions
```
✅ Shows when: `weddingLocation === null || weddingLocationUndecided === true`

---

### **When User HAS Venue:**
```
✓ Venue selected - you're ahead of the game!
```
✅ Shows when: `hasVenue === true`

### **When User DOESN'T HAVE Venue:**
```
🏛️ Browse venues in your area to find the perfect match
```
✅ Shows when: `hasVenue === false || hasVenue === null`

---

## 🔄 Data Type Handling

### **Firestore Timestamp → JavaScript Date**

The email integration correctly handles Firestore Timestamps:

```typescript
// Lines 73-86 in /lib/emailIntegrations.ts
let weddingDate = null;
if (userData.weddingDate) {
  if (userData.weddingDate.toDate) {
    // Firestore Timestamp
    weddingDate = userData.weddingDate.toDate();
  } else if (userData.weddingDate instanceof Date) {
    // Already a Date
    weddingDate = userData.weddingDate;
  } else if (typeof userData.weddingDate === 'string') {
    // String date
    weddingDate = new Date(userData.weddingDate);
  }
}
```

✅ **Handles all cases**: Firestore Timestamp, Date object, or string

## ✅ Verification Summary

| Field | Settings Page | Email Integration | Status |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| `weddingDate` | ✅ Saved as `Date` | ✅ Fetched & converted | ✅ **MATCH** |
| `weddingDateUndecided` | ✅ Saved as `boolean` | ✅ Fetched as `boolean` | ✅ **MATCH** |
| `weddingLocation` | ✅ Saved as `string` | ✅ Fetched as `string` | ✅ **MATCH** |
| `weddingLocationUndecided` | ✅ Saved as `boolean` | ✅ Fetched as `boolean` | ✅ **MATCH** |
| `hasVenue` | ✅ Saved as `boolean \| null` | ✅ Fetched as `boolean` | ✅ **MATCH** |
| `partnerName` | ✅ Saved as `string` | ✅ Fetched as `string` | ✅ **MATCH** |
| `guestCount` | ✅ Saved as `number` | ✅ Fetched as `number` | ✅ **MATCH** |
| `maxBudget` | ✅ Saved as `number` | ✅ Fetched as `number` | ✅ **MATCH** |

---

## 🎯 Conclusion

✅ **All fields used in the welcome email conditional logic match exactly with the fields saved from the Settings page.**

✅ **The conditional checks correctly mirror the Settings page logic:**
- Checks both the value AND the "undecided" flags
- Handles `null`, `false`, and `true` states correctly
- Converts Firestore Timestamps to JavaScript Dates properly

✅ **The email content will dynamically adapt based on the real user data from the Settings page!**

## 🧪 Test Confirmation

To verify this works with real user data:

1. Go to `/settings` in your app
2. Fill in different combinations of:
   - Wedding date (or check "We haven't decided yet")
   - Wedding location (or check "We haven't decided yet")
   - Venue status (Yes/Not yet)
3. Click "Save Changes"
4. Complete onboarding (or trigger the welcome email manually)
5. Check the email - it should reflect your exact settings!
