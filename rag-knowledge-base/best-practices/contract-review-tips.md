# Wedding Contract Review Best Practices

## Before Signing Any Contract

### 1. Read Everything Carefully
- Don't rush through the contract
- Ask questions about anything unclear
- Get everything in writing
- Don't rely on verbal promises

### 2. Key Areas to Focus On
- **Payment Terms**: When payments are due, what happens if you're late
- **Cancellation Policy**: What you get back if you cancel, vendor's right to cancel
- **Service Details**: Exactly what's included, what's extra
- **Timeline**: When services will be delivered
- **Force Majeure**: What happens in case of emergencies

### 3. Common Contract Pitfalls
- **Vague Language**: "Reasonable number of photos" vs "Minimum 400 edited photos"
- **Hidden Fees**: Setup fees, travel fees, overtime charges
- **No Backup Plans**: What happens if vendor can't perform
- **Unclear Deliverables**: When will you receive your photos/video
- **Excessive Cancellation Fees**: Some vendors charge 100% cancellation fees

### 4. Negotiation Tips
- **Bundle Services**: Ask for package deals
- **Off-Season Discounts**: Winter weddings often cost less
- **Weekday Discounts**: Friday/Sunday weddings can be cheaper
- **Payment Flexibility**: Ask for payment plans
- **Add-On Services**: Negotiate additional services at booking

### 5. Red Flags to Avoid
- Vendor won't provide written contract
- Pressure to sign immediately
- Unclear or missing contact information
- No references or portfolio
- Payment required in full upfront
- No cancellation policy
- Vague service descriptions

### 6. Questions to Always Ask
- What's included in the base price?
- What are additional charges for?
- What's your backup plan if you can't perform?
- When will I receive my deliverables?
- What's your cancellation policy?
- Do you have liability insurance?
- Can I see examples of your work?

### 7. After Signing
- Keep copies of all contracts
- Make payments on time
- Communicate any changes in writing
- Keep records of all communications
- Review contracts before final payment

## Remember
- It's your wedding and your money
- Don't be afraid to negotiate
- Get everything in writing
- Trust your instincts
- When in doubt, ask for clarification
