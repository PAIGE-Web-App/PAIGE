## ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Extend Paige to Dashboard and Budget Pages

**Estimated Time:** 6 hours  
**Complexity:** Medium  
**Risk:** Low (feature flag protected)  

---

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Checklist

### **Part 1: Dashboard Page Agent** (3 hours)

#### **Step 1: Add Dashboard Context to usePaigeInsights** (1.5 hours)
**File:** `components/paige/hooks/usePaigeInsights.ts`

**Add after todo context:**
```typescript
if (context === 'dashboard') {
  const daysUntilWedding = currentData?.daysUntilWedding || 365;
  const overdueTasks = currentData?.overdueTasks || 0;
  const upcomingDeadlines = currentData?.upcomingDeadlines || 0;
  const completedThisWeek = currentData?.completedThisWeek || 0;
  const budgetAllocated = currentData?.budgetStatus?.allocated || 0;
  
  // Dashboard-specific insights...
}
```

**Insights to Add:**
1. **Urgent Overview** (if overdue > 0)
   - "You have {X} overdue tasks - tackle these first!"
   - Action: Go to todo page with overdue filter

2. **Weekly Progress** (if completedThisWeek > 0)
   - "You completed {X} tasks this week - great job!"
   - Action: View completed tasks

3. **Budget Status** (if budget exists)
   - "Your budget is {X}% allocated - {status}"
   - Action: Go to budget page

4. **Days Until Wedding** (contextual urgency)
   - < 30 days: "Final month! Focus on confirmations"
   - < 60 days: "2 months left - time to finalize details"
   - < 90 days: "3 months - book remaining vendors"
   - Action: View priority checklist

5. **Missing Budget** (if no budget)
   - "Create a budget to track your wedding expenses"
   - Action: Go to budget page

6. **No Todos** (if todoCount === 0)
   - "Start planning! Add your first tasks"
   - Action: Go to todo page

7. **Vendor Suggestions** (if favorited but not contacted)
   - "You have {X} favorited vendors - ready to reach out?"
   - Action: Go to vendors page

8. **Next Milestone** (smart based on timeline)
   - "Next up: Book photographer (typical: 9-12 months out)"
   - Action: Browse photographers

#### **Step 2: Add Paige to Dashboard Page** (1 hour)
**File:** `app/dashboard/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
```typescript
import PaigeContextualAssistant from '@/components/PaigeContextualAssistant';
import { isPaigeChatEnabled } from '@/hooks/usePaigeChat';

// In component:
const isPaigeEnabled = isPaigeChatEnabled(user?.uid);

// In JSX (bottom-right):
{isPaigeEnabled && (
  <div className="fixed bottom-12 right-12 max-w-sm z-30">
    <PaigeContextualAssistant
      context="dashboard"
      currentData={{
        overdueTasks: // ... calculate from state
        upcomingDeadlines: // ... calculate
        completedThisWeek: // ... calculate
        daysUntilWedding: daysLeft,
        budgetStatus: {
          allocated: // ... from budget context
          spent: // ... from budget context
        },
        todoCount: // ... total todos
        vendorFavorites: // ... favorited vendors count
        recentActivity: // ... recent actions
      }}
    />
  </div>
)}
```

#### **Step 3: Test Dashboard Agent** (30 min)
- [ ] Paige appears on dashboard
- [ ] Shows relevant dashboard insights
- [ ] Actions navigate correctly
- [ ] Chat works
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Doesn't interfere with existing UI

---

### **Part 2: Budget Page Agent** (3 hours)

#### **Step 1: Add Budget Context to usePaigeInsights** (1.5 hours)
**File:** `components/paige/hooks/usePaigeInsights.ts`

**Add after dashboard context:**
```typescript
if (context === 'budget') {
  const totalBudget = currentData?.totalBudget || 0;
  const allocated = currentData?.allocated || 0;
  const spent = currentData?.spent || 0;
  const remaining = totalBudget - spent;
  const allocationPercent = totalBudget > 0 ? Math.round((allocated / totalBudget) * 100) : 0;
  const spendingPercent = totalBudget > 0 ? Math.round((spent / totalBudget) * 100) : 0;
  const upcomingPayments = currentData?.upcomingPayments || [];
  const categories = currentData?.categories || [];
  
  // Budget-specific insights...
}
```

**Insights to Add:**
1. **Over-Allocated** (if allocated > totalBudget)
   - "You've allocated {X}% of budget - consider adjusting"
   - Action: Review categories

2. **Under-Allocated** (if allocated < 80% && wedding < 6 months)
   - "Only {X}% allocated - plan for remaining categories"
   - Action: Add categories

3. **High Category Spend** (if any category > 40%)
   - "Venue is {X}% of budget (industry avg: 30%)"
   - Action: Review allocation

4. **Upcoming Payments** (if payments due this month)
   - "{X} payments due this month - total ${amount}"
   - Action: View payment schedule

5. **Missing Categories** (if < 5 categories)
   - "Add more categories to track all expenses"
   - Action: Common categories suggestion

6. **Within Budget** (if spent < 90% allocated)
   - "Great job! You're {X}% under budget"
   - Action: Explore upgrade options

7. **Budget Almost Maxed** (if spent > 90%)
   - "You've spent {X}% - watch remaining expenses"
   - Action: Review spending

8. **Vendor Budget Matching**
   - "Looking for photographers? Your photo budget: ${amount}"
   - Action: Browse photographers in budget range

---

#### **Step 2: Add Paige to Budget Page** (1 hour)
**File:** `app/budget/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
```typescript
import PaigeContextualAssistant from '@/components/PaigeContextualAssistant';
import { isPaigeChatEnabled } from '@/hooks/usePaigeChat';

// In component:
const isPaigeEnabled = isPaigeChatEnabled(user?.uid);

// Calculate budget metrics:
const allocated = categories.reduce((sum, cat) => sum + cat.allocated, 0);
const spent = categories.reduce((sum, cat) => sum + cat.spent, 0);

// In JSX:
{isPaigeEnabled && (
  <div className="fixed bottom-12 right-12 max-w-sm z-30">
    <PaigeContextualAssistant
      context="budget"
      currentData={{
        totalBudget: maxBudget,
        allocated: allocated,
        spent: spent,
        remaining: maxBudget - spent,
        categories: categories,
        upcomingPayments: // ... filter payments due this month
        daysUntilWedding: daysLeft,
        weddingLocation: location,
      }}
    />
  </div>
)}
```
