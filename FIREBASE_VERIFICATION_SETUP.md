# Firebase Email Verification Setup Fix

## 🚨 The Problem
Your email verification links are going to `/__/auth/action` (Firebase's default) instead of your custom verification page, causing a 404 error.

## ✅ The Solution

### Option 1: Update Firebase Console (Recommended)

1. **Go to Firebase Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. **Select your project**: PAIGE-Web-App
3. **Navigate to**: Authentication → Templates → Email address verification
4. **Click "Customize action URL"**
5. **Set the action URL to**: `https://weddingpaige.com/__/auth/action`
6. **Save the changes**

### Option 2: Use the Custom Handler (Already Implemented)

I've created a custom handler at `/app/__/auth/action/page.tsx` that will:
- Process the Firebase verification
- Check if the user is verified
- Redirect to the appropriate page

## 🔧 What I Fixed

1. **Created custom auth action handler** at `/app/__/auth/action/page.tsx`
2. **Updated sendEmailVerification** to use `handleCodeInApp: false`
3. **Added proper error handling** and user feedback

## 🧪 Testing

1. **Sign up with a new email**
2. **Check your email** for the verification link
3. **Click the verification link**
4. **You should be redirected** to the signup page with verification success

## 📝 Notes

- The custom handler will work with Firebase's default action URL
- Users will see a loading screen while verification is processed
- Success/error messages will be shown appropriately
- The verification flow will work seamlessly

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Deploy these changes** to production
2. **Test the verification flow** with a real email
3. **Optionally update Firebase Console** for cleaner URLs (but not required)
