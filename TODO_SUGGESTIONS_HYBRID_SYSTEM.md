## üìä HOW IT WORKS

### **Scenario: User Switches to "Photographer" Contact**

#### **Before (Old Behavior):**
```
1. User clicks "Photographer"
2. Auto-check runs (checkForNewOnly: true)
3. Finds 2 new emails
4. AI analyzes both emails
5. Generates 2 todo suggestions
6. ‚ùå Results lost (no modal shown because userInitiated = false)
7. User never knows todos were suggested
```

#### **After (New Behavior):**
```
1. User clicks "Photographer"
2. Auto-check runs with storeSuggestionsMode: true
3. Finds 2 new emails
4. AI analyzes both emails (same cost as before)
5. Generates 2 todo suggestions
6. ‚úÖ Suggestions stored in contact document:
   users/{userId}/contacts/{contactId}/pendingTodoSuggestions
7. ‚úÖ Purple badge [2] appears on sidebar
8. ‚úÖ Banner appears: "Paige found 2 action items"
9. User clicks "Review & Add"
10. ‚úÖ Modal opens with suggestions
11. User accepts/rejects ‚Üí Todos created
12. Badge disappears, banner disappears
```
