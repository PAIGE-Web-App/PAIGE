## 📖 Usage Guide

### For Developers

#### 1. Protecting AI API Routes

```typescript
import { withCreditValidation } from '@/lib/creditMiddleware';

// Wrap your API handler
export const POST = withCreditValidation(handleAIRequest, {
  feature: 'file_analysis',
  userIdField: 'userId',
  requireAuth: true,
  errorMessage: 'Insufficient credits for this feature'
});
```

#### 2. Using Credits in Frontend

```typescript
import { useCredits } from '@/hooks/useCredits';

function MyComponent() {
  const { 
    credits, 
    useCredits, 
    validateCredits,
    canUseFeature 
  } = useCredits();

  const handleAIFeature = async () => {
    if (await validateCredits('file_analysis')) {
      const success = await useCredits('file_analysis');
      if (success) {
        // Proceed with AI feature
      }
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {canUseFeature('file_analysis') && (
        <button onClick={handleAIFeature}>
          Analyze File
        </button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### 3. Displaying Credit Status

```typescript
import { CreditDisplay } from '@/components/CreditDisplay';

// Compact display for navigation
<CreditDisplay variant="compact" />

// Banner display for prominent placement
<CreditDisplay variant="banner" />

// Full display for detailed view
<CreditDisplay variant="full" />
```

### For Users

#### 1. Viewing Credits
- Navigate to the Credits page (`/credits`)
- Check the compact display in the left navigation
- View detailed credit information and usage history

#### 2. Understanding Credit Usage
- Credits refresh monthly
- Different AI features cost different amounts
- Free tier users have limited access to AI features
- Premium plans provide more credits and features

#### 3. Managing Credits
- Monitor usage through the dashboard
- Upgrade plans for more credits
- View transaction history
- Test credit validation and usage

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
No additional environment variables required. The system uses existing Firebase configuration.

### Firebase Structure
The credit system creates the following structure:
```
users/{userId}/
  credits/
    main - User credit information
    transactions/ - Credit transaction history
```

### Customization
- Modify credit allocations in `types/credits.ts`
- Adjust credit costs for features
- Change refresh intervals in `creditService.ts`
- Customize display components in `CreditDisplay.tsx`

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Page
Visit `/credits` to test:
- Credit validation
- Credit usage
- Credit addition
- Feature access control

### API Testing
Use the credit middleware to protect any AI API route:
```typescript
// Example: Protect todo generation API
export const POST = withCreditValidation(handleTodoGeneration, {
  feature: 'todo_generation',
  userIdField: 'userId'
});
```
