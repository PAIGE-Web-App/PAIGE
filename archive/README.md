## Settings Components

### SelectedVendorsTab.tsx
- **Archived**: 2024-12-19
- **Reason**: User decided the Selected Vendors tab in settings wasn't needed
- **Functionality**: Displayed and managed selected vendors for AI content generation
- **Dependencies**: 
  - Used `selectedVendors` from user profile
  - Had category management and vendor removal functionality
  - Integrated with Firestore for persistence
- **Note**: The core selected vendors functionality still exists in the vendors page and vendor detail pages - only the settings tab was removed
