  - Vendor Accountability
  - User Accountability
  - Important Dates
  - Payment Terms
  - Cancellation Policy
  - Gotchas (areas to watch out for)
  - Recommendations
- **Follow-up Questions**: Support for ongoing conversation about documents
- **Fallback Parsing**: Text-based parsing if JSON parsing fails

### 3. Updated useFiles Hook (`hooks/useFiles.ts`)
- **AI Processing Integration**: Real AI analysis instead of mock data
- **Status Management**: Proper processing status updates
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

### 4. Enhanced AIFileAnalyzer Component (`components/AIFileAnalyzer.tsx`)
